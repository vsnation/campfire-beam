/* Ethereum words (create, step 1 of 3)
 * Spec: ONE job: write down the Ethereum wallet's 12 words.
 *       Primary CTA: "I wrote them down" (enabled once the words are shown).
 *       Taps from app open: 2 (Home -> Ethereum -> Create).
 * Exit-intent reasons and answers:
 *   - "More words? I already wrote 12" -> said plainly: these are different from the BEAM words,
 *     and only they bring the Ethereum wallet back.
 *   - "Someone could see my screen" -> blurred until tapped (the same grid as the BEAM words).
 *   - "Can I screenshot it?" -> no, and why (photos sync to the cloud).
 *   - "Can I see them later?" -> no: they are never stored; said here, before the person moves on.
