/* IP privacy notice (before the first connection to any BEAM node; also Settings -> IP privacy)
 * Spec: ONE job: tell the person, before anything connects, who can see their IP address.
 *       Primary CTA: "Connect" (secondary: "How to hide my IP"). In Settings: "Done".
 *       Taps from app open: right after setup (create/restore), once per device.
 * Exit-intent reasons and answers:
 *   - "A privacy coin that leaks my IP?" -> said first, with the two fixes that work on an iPhone.
 *   - "Is Private Relay enough?" -> honest: Apple documents it for Safari; for a Home Screen
 *     app it is not documented, so a VPN is the sure way.
 *   - "What else does the node learn?" -> listed: when you're online and the payments you send;
 *     never your amounts or your 12 words.
