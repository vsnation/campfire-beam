/* IP privacy (Settings -> IP privacy). Not a setup step: create, restore and import go straight
 * to connecting (owner, 2026-10-10: optional, never in the way of a new wallet).
 * Spec: ONE job: say who can see the person's IP address, and how to hide it.
 *       Primary CTA: "Done" (secondary: "How to hide my IP").
 *       Taps from app open: 2 (Settings -> IP privacy).
 * Exit-intent reasons and answers:
 *   - "A privacy coin that leaks my IP?" -> said first, with the two fixes that work on an iPhone.
 *   - "Is Private Relay enough?" -> honest: Apple documents it for Safari; for a Home Screen
 *     app it is not documented, so a VPN is the sure way.
 *   - "What else does the node learn?" -> listed: when you're online and the payments you send;
 *     never your amounts or your 12 words.
